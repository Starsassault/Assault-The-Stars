				Hello stars!

This is my first try at coding. And it's definitely going to be one hell of a ride. I probably die first before being able to say I understand coding, ever! But that doesn't matter. Life is meaningless anyway and perfection should be removed from the dictionary. So what is next? My assault at the stars, a shot in the darkness of the light of life.*

Not to sound cliche but eh, it's just a romantisized metaphor do induce some endorfines.
